<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 22 years old university student, majoring in oriental languages. I have always had many
  different passions, ranging from learning languages and knowledge of related cultures to an
  interest in information technology and its many applications. During my university career I had the
  opportunity to carry out various mobility programs abroad, which helped me develop greater
  intercultural awareness.</p>
